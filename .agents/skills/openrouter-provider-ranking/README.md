# OpenRouter Provider Ranking

Select the provider route that should serve a known OpenRouter model slug. This
skill is the endpoint-routing half of the repository's model-selection workflow:
it turns workload constraints and a chosen model into an exact
`endpoint × reasoning effort`, routing mode, fallback order, and verification
plan. The sibling [`model-that-fits-my-task`](../model-that-fits-my-task/SKILL.md)
skill chooses the model first.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add rodion-m/model-that-fits-my-task@openrouter-provider-ranking -g -y
```

The bundled ranker requires Python 3.10 or newer and uses only the Python standard library. Live endpoint discovery also requires outbound HTTPS and an OpenRouter key exposed through `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; offline endpoint JSON works without a key.

## When to use it

Use this skill when you need to:

- compare OpenRouter provider endpoints for one model by throughput, TTFT, end-to-end latency, expected price, uptime, cache behavior, quality, privacy, quantization, or context limits;
- create a deterministic `provider.order` failover chain;
- decide between native `:exacto`, a manual ranking, and OpenRouter's built-in `provider.sort` modes;
- combine OpenRouter endpoint data with provider-tagged production telemetry;
- verify the top candidates with real requests before treating a catalogue-based ranking as a production decision;
- explain which endpoints were excluded and which signals are missing or uncertain.

It is not a general model-selection skill. Its scope is endpoint-level routing after the OpenRouter model slug is known.

## Quick start

Run against the live OpenRouter Endpoints API:

```bash
cd .agents/skills/openrouter-provider-ranking
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
python3 scripts/rank_providers.py \
  --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731 \
  --config assets/config.example.json \
  --format markdown \
  --output recommendation.md
```

Run a reproducible offline analysis:

```bash
python3 scripts/rank_providers.py \
  --endpoints-file endpoints.json \
  --config config.json \
  --observations telemetry.jsonl \
  --previous-ranking previous-result.json \
  --output result.json
```

The output includes the selected routing mode, eligible and excluded endpoints, score components, workload-level expected cost, coverage warnings, and a ready-to-use OpenRouter request fragment. The ranking is a hypothesis until the top candidates have been checked on the workload profile that will ship.

Verify candidates with real requests when a decision depends on catalogue fields such as caching, TTFT, throughput, or contract compliance:

```bash
python3 scripts/probe_endpoints.py \
  --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731 \
  --providers coreweave/fp8,fireworks,siliconflow/fp8 \
  --prompt-file real-prompt.txt \
  --max-tokens 600 --runs 3 \
  --min-tps 50 --max-ttft 6 --require-cache --require-max-tokens
```

The probe reports measured TTFT, TPS, cost, cache hit share, completion-token compliance, and error class against the thresholds you provide.

## Routing modes

| Mode | Best fit | Generated routing |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| `native-exacto` | Tool-calling without a fixed provider order | Uses the model's `:exacto` suffix and omits `provider.sort` and `provider.order` |
| `manual` | Deterministic failover or strong production telemetry | Emits `provider.order` from the computed ranking |
| Native OpenRouter sort | A single simple optimization objective | Uses `provider.sort` for price, throughput, or latency |

The skill treats hard compatibility requirements as filters, never as score penalties that a fast or cheap incompatible endpoint could overcome. Missing quality, cache, or benchmark data receives a conservative prior and an uncertainty penalty instead of invented values.

python3 scripts/validate_skill.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

## Security

Do not place API keys in configs, telemetry, logs, or generated output. The ranker reads the key from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or an explicitly selected environment variable.
